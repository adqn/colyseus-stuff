Colyseus setup using React and Webpack. Runs client and server in one go. More to come.

Will eventually clean this up and make a separate repo for an actual game - feel free to delete everything and use it as a template if you'd like.

###### Note: ```yarn install``` currently throws all dependencies into top-level package.json. Not ideal.

## Install and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/adqn/colyseus-stuff.git
cd colyseus-stuff
yarn install
yarn start
```
